TimedEvent JS By Rutvij Dhotey.

This is a documentation file for the TimedEvent Application/Library I built.

I have 2 main attributes in my script file:
  1. X-axis
  2. Events
  
The events are laid out with logic of pixels and padding.
All the events given in the example JSON are included.
The Following features are available :
  1. Over Lapping Dates occur on separate lines.
  2. Uses only as many lanes needed.
  3. There is a way to add and delete events.
  4. Can accommodate more than 50 events at a time.
  5. Summary Shown on mouseover. 
  6. UI/UX Implementation
  7. Data Persistence
  
TO DO :
  1. Backend Database.
  2. Zoom Adjust
  3. API Design
  4. Non-Contigious Time management.

The implementation that I have also considers varying resolutions and can be responsive to them. The scale adjusts itself accordingly.
The Delete of an event automatically re-adjusts all the events in the best possible way, and so does the addition of a new event.
The limitations right now are :

  1. zoom
  2. grid system
  3. better form submission
  4. Null input Management.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Please note that I have used Jquery and just have the internet connected to access it via google.

TO OPEN:
To open the application, just open the Index.html file.
